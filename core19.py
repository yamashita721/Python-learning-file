# vallidating user input using string

# 24-08-2025 today while learning i realised that after learning
# making your own project on that topic is so important, so
# plese keep on building while learning, don't keep the building part
# for the end the sooner you realise that, good you become at coding

#name = input("enter your full name: ")
# len() - length function gives the length of user input
# result = len(name)

#result = name.find(" ") # the find function gives the first occurance of  the given character : the position an
# the first chracter Y in yamashita will have the index of zero
# that's why the space postion shows 4

# if you want the last occurance we have a differ option
#result = name.rfind("f")
# also if character isn't in the input it will give negative number
#name = name.capitalize()
# it capitaliz first letter
#name = name.upper()
# well it's makes every letter capital
#name = name.lower()
#result = name.isdigit()
# it's an boolean which gives true or false
#result = name.isalpha()
# it's also an boolean it gives true when input is only alphabet


# NOW LET'S ASK FOR AN PHONE NUMBER
#phone_number = input("enter your number #: ")
# in num they basically counts dashes
#result = phone_number.count("-")
#phone_number = phone_number.replace("-", "")


#print(phone_number)

print(help(str)

      # SO THESE ARE SOME FEW USEFUL STRING METHODS
